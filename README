This is a small library that focuses on getting an OpenGL-enabled
window and receiving input. The API is still unstable and evolving.
The library has a few goals:

  · go-gettable: only use libraries installed by default
  · focused: only events and window creation. use whatever GL lib you like
  · idiomatic: Events received on a channel, no callbacks
