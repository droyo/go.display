// Package display provides functions for creating OpenGL
// and receiving input events.
//
// The display package is cross-platform, and should work
// on Windows, Linux, and OSX. There are, however, differences
// in the host platform's capabilities that will affect the
// way code is written. Most notably, on OSX the event listener
// must be run in the main thread.
